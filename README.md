Here we are going to craete an android app for giving bicycles on lease but for free ,for the use in the campus only.
We simply first make a authentication of the user.
then we do a check for the availability of the cycle at that particular pickup point.
now we will ask them to provide the information regarding their journey which includes the duration of lease,pickup point,drop point.
Then finally we will assing cycle to them along with the informtion regarding the time allocated.
